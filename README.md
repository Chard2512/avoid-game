# Concept

Avoid is a game where the player must survive the longest as possible without get hit by any ball that bounces on the screen, moving the character around and avoiding them

# How to Compile It

I'll assume you're working on Windows, but Linux or Mac might take similar steps

First, you need pip and pyinstaller on your machine (okay?)

Then open the terminal on the project src folder and run the command

``` pyinstaller --onefile avoid.py
